Assignment at Carleton: Data analytics to group clients according to usage characteristics


Consider that you are the Information Processing Specialist for a telecommunication company. The general manager acquired your help to group the company clients based on their usage for services. The data that has the clients’ usage can be found in “Telecom” file in CuLearn.
Do the following tasks and answer the inquiries in order achieve the required grouping task.

1. As the company is planning to make promotion plans for clients based on their use for their services. Group clients based on their monthly usage for local, long distance and international calls durations by using k-means, Kohonen and two-steps clustering algorithms. For k-means and Kohonen make 5 data clusters (groups) and for the two-step algorithm keep the number of clusters (groups) between 2 and 7. The software that can be used for this assignment is SPSS Modeler.

2. Try to do the best setting possible for the algorithms to have the best clusters (groups of clients)

3. For each of the three clustering models, try to generate 3D model that represent the clusters. The model should have the three usage factors mentioned above (local, long distance and international calls durations); and should show each cluster with different color. Take a screenshot for each of the graphs and past them in this document. (6 Marks)

4. For each one of the three clustering algorithms result, explain whether it was good clustering or not with justification

5. Which clustering result do you think it was the best with justification?
